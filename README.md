# cardnames

## To Do:

Allow front-end to specify multiple json files
Change json format to object:
  key is "title" of card
  value is object, or list of objects:
    - subtitle
    - prefix
    - suffix
    - {top|bottom}-{left|right}

20 keys are chosen, when a key is chosen one of it's objects is picked at random.

Allows for:
  Gandalf the Grey (The Grey Pilgrim) - FR
  Gandalf the White (The White Rider) - TT
  Gandalf (Wandering Wizard) - H

But only ever one "gandalf" at a time
